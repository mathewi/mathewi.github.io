In 2011, two photographers [entered the so-called "No go zone" that extends](https://www.fukushima-nogozone.com/copie-de-a-no-man-s-land) for about 20 kilometres around the site of the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan, which flooded during the tsunami in March of 2011, [shutting down the power and cooling](https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/fukushima-daiichi-accident.aspx) systems for three of the plant's reactors, which leaked radioactive fuel. About 150,000 people had to be [evacuated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster), and they left everything behind, including farm animals, personal belongings and cars -- all of which was quickly overgrown with vines and other vegetation.

The photographers also too pictures of some former townspeople in their shops and places of work, all of which have been more or less destroyed by shoplifters and vandals.
