If you were a member of the elite in the 1800s or so, you would of course have a massive house in the country with dozens of rooms and gardens and servants, etc. At the time, it was also the convention to have an artfully natural looking area of forest and rocks, etc. complete with a "hermit house," which was usually a one-room hut made from stones and twigs. And if you wanted to complete the picture, you might even hire someone [to be your own personal hermit](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/500916/short-lived-british-fashion-ornamental-hermits) -- to sit in the hermit house in some sort of rough-hewn garment, dispensing wisdom, etc.

> It’s not clear who first started the trend, but at some point in the early 18th century, having a resident hermit quietly contemplating existence—and occasionally sharing some golden nugget of wisdom with visitors—came to be seen as a must-have accessory for the perfect garden idyll.  
> Real hermits were hard to find, so wealthy landowners had to get creative. Some put advertisements in the press, offering food, lodging, and a stipend for those willing to adopt a life of solitude.

According to [this Mental Floss article](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/500916/short-lived-british-fashion-ornamental-hermits), the Honourable Charles Hamilton bought a giant Surrey estate called Painshill Park and extensively remodelled the grounds, creating a lake, numerous grottoes, a Chinese bridge, a temple, and a hermitage on his estate. He then placed [an ad](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/gardenstovisit/10159553/The-glorious-restoration-of-Painshill-Parks-grotto.html) for a hermit to live there for seven years in exchange for £700 (roughly $900, or $77,000 in today’s money). "The hermit was not allowed to speak to anyone, cut their hair, or leave the estate. Unfortunately, the successful applicant was discovered in the local pub just three weeks after being appointed."
