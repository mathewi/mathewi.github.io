I'm a journalist who lives in Canada and writes about the intersection between technology and the media. At the moment, I am the chief digital writer with the Columbia Journalism Review, where I've worked since 2017. Prior to that I was a senior writer with Fortune magazine, and before that with a blog network called Gigaom. Before that, I spent 15 years as a business and technology reporter and columnist with the Globe and Mail, a daily newspaper in Toronto before becoming the paper's first blogger, and helping develop and run the Globe's social media, including web comments, Twitter, Facebook, live-blogging, etc.
